## Installation ##

1. Extract all files, and place into a directory that is accessible to the web server, and able to run PHP.
2. Setup correct permissions on files and folders:
	* `chmod -R 777 app/Config`
	* `chmod -R 777 app/files`
	* `chmod -R 777 app/tmp`
	* `chmod -R 777 app/Plugin`
3. Access the site via your web server. If you installed into a subdirectory, then ensure that directory is in your URL: http://mysite.com/candycane
4. The step-by-step installer will appear.
5. Just use it!

## Development setup ##

1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox.
2. Download candycane box
	`vagrant box add candycane {url}`
3. just type `vagrant up`
4. ssh into vm
	`vagrant ssh`
5. cd to app
	`cd /vagrant_data/app`
6. run test
	`./Console/cake test app All`

## Updating to latest version ##

You need to copy these file and directories into extracted latest codes.
Currently we don't make database schema change.

- app/Config/database.php
- app/files
- app/Plugin


## Notes ##

Currently some features which are present in Redmine are not supported by CandyCane. These are:

- Repository viewer
- Forum
- Documents

CandyCane is using CakePHP v2.3.
