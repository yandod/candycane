# CandyCane #

CandyCane is a issue tracking system. The original implementation on which it is based, is [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org)

You can view a live demo of CandyCane, as well as the bug tracking for CandyCane here: [http://my.candycane.jp/](http://my.candycane.jp/)

Continuous Integration is running on here: [http://ci.candycane.jp:8080/](http://ci.candycane.jp:8080/)


## Installation ##

1. Extract all files, and place into a directory that is accessible to the web server, and able to run PHP.
2. Setup correct permissions on files and folders:
	* `chmod -R 777 app/Config`
	* `chmod -R 777 app/files`
	* `chmod -R 777 app/tmp`
	* `chmod -R 777 app/Plugin`
3. Access the site via your web server. If you installed into a subdirectory, then ensure that directory is in your URL: http://mysite.com/candycane
4. The step-by-step installer will appear.
5. Just use it!


## Notes ##

Currently some features which are present in Redmine are not supported by CandyCane. These are:

- Repository viewer
- Forum
- Documents

CandyCane is using CakePHP v2.1. But using some PHP5 syntax in codes.
