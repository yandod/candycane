//--------------------
// How to install.
//--------------------
1. extract all files and place to directory which is able to run php.
2. chmod all files to 777 (or in the very least, /app/config/ , /app/tmp/cache/ and /app/tmp/files/)
3. access to url to show that directory by web  browser.
4. step by step installer shows up.
5. just use it!


//--------------------
// Notes.
//--------------------
Currently some features are missing as RedMine.
- repository viewer
- forum
- documents
- global search

Using CakePHP1.2, so candycane can still run on PHP4
