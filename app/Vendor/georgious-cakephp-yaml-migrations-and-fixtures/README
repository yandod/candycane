WHAT IS THIS?
This package cointains migrations and fixtures libraries to be used with the CakePHP framework. It does not require any
external packages except for the CakePHP framework and the SPYC class (included in this package but *not* authored by me)

HOW TO USE?
Just put all files ( except for this README ) in your CakePHP vendors folder. 

If you want to use the API only, simply include the classes in your code ( App::Import('vendor', 'migrations' ) and/or 
App::Import('vendor', 'fixtures' ) ). For further details, please reference to the docs of the classes.

To use the migrations shell, use your cake console - type ./cake migrate help for details.
